# Image-Processing-and-Retrieval-Matlab
Image based image search engine
Content-based image retrieval systems work with whole images and searching is based on comparison of the query. 
General techniques for image retrieval are color, texture and shape. These techniques are applied to get an image from the image. They are not concerned with the various resolutions of the images, size and spatial color distribution. Hence all these methods are not appropriate to the art image retrieval. Moreover shape based retrievals are useful only in the limited domain.
The content and metadata based system gives images using an effective image retrieval technique. 

STEPS TO RUN THE CODE:
